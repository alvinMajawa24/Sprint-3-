                                The Central Bus Station, situated on Temple Road between Mfangano Street and Uyoma Street, was for a  long time reserved for the exclusive use of Kenya Bus Service(KBS), the oldest public transport company in Nairobi which at one time had a monopoly on intra-city mass transport services in Nairobi and Mombasa.

                                In the mid 1980's, Nyayo Bus Service was introduced, and the smaller 14-seater Matatus started appearing on the scene, bringing to an end the long running KBS monopoly.<br> While the Nyayo Bus Service has since collapsed, other bus companies,other bus companies have emerged to take its place.

                            <p> Matatus in this stage usually cover the following routes:
