    <h1 style="text-align: left;">WELCOME TO THE BUS STATION KENYA</h1>
   <h2 style="color: darkgreen;"> More info</h2>
    <p> The Central Bus Station, situated on Temple Road between Mfangano Street and Uyoma Street, was for a  long time reserved for the exclusive use of Kenya Bus Service(KBS), the oldest public transport company in Nairobi which at one time had a monopoly on intra-city mass transport services in Nairobi and Mombasa.
    </p>

    <p> In the mid 1980's, Nyayo Bus Service was introduced, and the smaller 14-seater Matatus started appearing on the scene, bringing to an end the long running KBS monopoly.<br> While the Nyayo Bus Service has since collapsed, other bus companies,other bus companies have emerged to take its place.</p>

    <p> Matatus in this stage usually cover the following routes:
        <ul>
            <li>South B</li>
            <li>South C</Canvas></li>
            <li>Nairobi West/Madaraka</li>
            <li>Highrise/Raila Odinga Road</li>
            <li>Kitengela</li>
            <li>Umoja</li>
            <li>Ruai-Joska</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
